    "Specifically, are there functions that cannot be modeled with a Neural Network?\n",

    "Interestingly, Neural Networks with at least one hidden layer are universal approximators [[Cybenko](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02551274), [Nielsen](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html)]. \n",
    "This means that for any continuous function $g(x)$ and any small $ \\epsilon>0 $, there exists a Neural Network $\\psi(x)$ with one hidden layer  (using a suitable non-linearity, such as sigmoid) such that $∣ f(x)−g(x) ∣ < \\epsilon$ for all $x$. \n",
    "In other words, neural networks can approximate any continuous function arbitrarily closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one hidden layer suffices to approximate any function, why use more layers and go deeper? \n",
    "The answer is that the fact that a two-layer Neural Network is a universal approximator, while intriguing mathematically, is not always practically useful. \n",
    "In one dimension, the ''sum of indicator bumps'' function $f(x)= \\sum_i c_i1(a_i<x<b_i)$ where a,b,c are parameter vectors is also a universal approximator, but no one would suggest that we use this functional form in Machine Learning. \n",
    "Neural Networks work well in practice because they compactly express nice, smooth functions that fit well with the statistical properties of data we encounter in practice, and are also easy to learn using our optimization algorithms (e.g. gradient descent). \n",
    "\n",
    "Empirically, deeper networks (with multiple hidden layers) often perform better than shallow networks, despite having equivalent representational power.\n",
    "As an aside, in practice, three-layer neural networks often outperform two-layer networks, but deeper networks (four, five, or more layers) may not consistently offer additional benefits.\n",

    "Recall that a neural network consists of an input layer, an output layer, and zero or more hidden layers. \n",
    "Once a network has been trained, when you present an input to the network, the network will propagate the inputs through its layers to produce an output. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the input represents an instance of the task, the output should be the solution to that instance after the network has been trained. Thus, one can view a neural network as a general pattern associator. \n",
    "In general, as far as the design of a neural network is concerned, you always begin by identifying the size of the input and output layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a task, the first step is to identify the nature of inputs to the pattern associator. \n",
    "This is normally in the form of number of neurons required to represent the input. \n",
    "Similarly, you will need to determine how many output neurons will be required. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, note that as we increase the size and number of layers in a Neural Network, the capacity of the network increases. \n",
    "That is, the space of representable functions grows since the neurons can collaborate to express many different functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can observe that Neural Networks with more neurons can express more complicated functions. \n",
    "However, this is both a blessing (since we can learn to classify more complicated data) and a curse (since it is easier to overfit the training data). \n",
    "**Overfitting** occurs when a model with high capacity fits the noise in the data instead of the (assumed) underlying relationship. \n",
    "For example, the model with 20 hidden neurons fits all the training data but at the cost of segmenting the space into many disjoint decision regions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our discussion above, it seems that smaller neural networks can be preferred if the data is not complex enough to prevent overfitting. \n",
    "However, this is incorrect - there are many other preferred ways to prevent overfitting in Neural Networks (such as L2 regularization, dropout, input noise). \n",
    "In practice, it is always better to use these methods to control overfitting instead of the number of neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The subtle reason behind this is that smaller networks are harder to train with local methods such as Gradient Descent: \n",
    "It’s clear that their loss functions have relatively few local minima, but it turns out that many of these minima are easier to converge to, and that they are bad (i.e. with high loss). \n",
    "Conversely, bigger neural networks contain significantly more local minima, but these minima turn out to be much better in terms of their actual loss. \n",
    "Since Neural Networks are non-convex, it is hard to study these properties mathematically, but some attempts to understand these objective functions have been made, \n",
    "e.g. in a recent paper The Loss Surfaces of Multilayer Networks. \n",
    "In practice, what you find is that if you train a small network the final loss can display a good amount of variance - in some cases you get lucky and converge to a good place but in some cases you get trapped in one of the bad minima. \n",
    "On the other hand, if you train a large network you’ll start to find many different solutions, but the variance in the final achieved loss will be much smaller. \n",
    "In other words, all solutions are about equally as good, and rely less on the luck of random initialization.\n",

As you start overfitting, you'll see the training loss continue to decrease while the validation loss starts to increase.\n",

If the number of hidden neurons is too low, then the model won't have enough space to learn and if it is too high there are too many options for the direction that the learning can take. The trick here is to find the right balance in number of hidden neurons you choose."

    "- Sigmoid. \n",
    "It takes a real-valued number and ''squashes'' it into range between 0 and 1. \n",
    "In particular, large negative numbers become 0 and large positive numbers become 1. \n",
    "The sigmoid function has seen frequent use historically since it has a nice interpretation as the firing rate of a neuron: \n",
    "from not firing at all (0) to fully-saturated firing at an assumed maximum frequency (1). \n",
    "In practice, the sigmoid non-linearity has recently fallen out of favor and it is rarely ever used. \n",
    "It has two major drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Sigmoids saturate and kill gradients. \n",
    "    A very undesirable property of the sigmoid neuron is that when the neuron's activation saturates at either tail of 0 or 1, the gradient at these regions is almost zero. \n",
    "    Recall that during backpropagation, this (local) gradient will be multiplied to the gradient of this gate's output for the whole objective. \n",
    "    Therefore, if the local gradient is very small, it will effectively ''kill'' the gradient and almost no signal will flow through the neuron to its weights and recursively to its data.\n",
    "    Additionally, one must pay extra caution when initializing the weights of sigmoid neurons to prevent saturation. \n",
    "    For example, if the initial weights are too large then most neurons would become saturated and the network will barely learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Sigmoid outputs are not zero-centered. \n",
    "    This is undesirable since neurons in later layers of processing in a Neural Network would be receiving data that is not zero-centered. \n",
    "    This has implications on the dynamics during gradient descent, because if the data coming into a neuron is always positive, then the gradient on the weights $w$ will during backpropagation become either all be positive, or all negative (depending on the gradient of the whole expression $f$. \n",
    "    This could introduce undesirable zig-zagging dynamics in the gradient updates for the weights. \n",
    "    However, notice that once these gradients are added up across a batch of data the final update for the weights can have variable signs, somewhat mitigating this issue. \n",
    "    Therefore, this is an inconvenience but it has less severe consequences compared to the saturated activation problem above.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tanh. \n",
    "It squashes a real-valued number to the range [-1, 1]. \n",
    "Like the sigmoid neuron, its activations saturate, but unlike the sigmoid neuron its output is zero-centered. \n",
    "Therefore, in practice the tanh non-linearity is always preferred to the sigmoid nonlinearity. \n",
    "Also note that the tanh neuron is simply a scaled sigmoid neuron, in particular the following holds: $\\tanh(x)=2\\sigma(2x)−1$\n",
    "\n",
    "- ReLU.\n",
    "The Rectified Linear Unit has become very popular in the last few years. \n",
    "It computes the function $f(x)=\\max(0,x)$. \n",
    "In other words, the activation is simply thresholded at zero. \n",
    "There are several pros and cons to using the ReLUs:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - (+) It was found to greatly accelerate (e.g. a factor of 6 in [[Krizhevsky et al.](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/imagenet.pdf)]) the convergence of stochastic gradient descent compared to the sigmoid/tanh functions. \n",
    "    It is argued that this is due to its linear, non-saturating form.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - (+) Compared to tanh/sigmoid neurons that involve expensive operations (exponentials, etc.), the ReLU can be implemented by simply thresholding a matrix of activations at zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - (-) Unfortunately, ReLU units can be fragile during training and can ''die''. \n",
    "    For example, a large gradient flowing through a ReLU neuron could cause the weights to update in such a way that the neuron will never activate on any datapoint again. \n",
    "    If this happens, then the gradient flowing through the unit will forever be zero from that point on. \n",
    "    That is, the ReLU units can irreversibly die during training since they can get knocked off the data manifold. \n",
    "    For example, you may find that as much as 40% of your network can be ''dead'' (i.e. neurons that never activate across the entire training dataset) if the learning rate is set too high. \n",
    "    With a proper setting of the learning rate this is less frequently an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- LeakyReLU.\n",
    "Leaky ReLUs are one attempt to fix the ''dying ReLU'' problem.\n",
    "Instead of the function being zero when x < 0, a leaky ReLU will instead have a small positive slope (of 0.01, or so). \n",
    "Some people report success with this form of activation function, but the results are not always consistent. \n",
    "The slope in the negative region can also be made into a parameter of each neuron, as seen in PReLU neurons, introduced in [He et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01852). \n",
    "However, the consistency of the benefit across tasks is presently unclear."

    "This means that most of the time, for your data, the values of the neurons should be between 0.2 and 0.8. \n",
    "This is because we do not want to neurons to have too many values of zeros and ones. \n",
    "When that happens, the gradient is small and thus the training is much longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choosing Learning Rate.\n",
    "Picking a good learning rate α can be tricky. \n",
    "A large learning rate can change the parameters too aggressively or a small learning rate can change the parameters too conservatively. \n",
    "Both should be avoided, a good learning rate is one that leads to good overall improvements in the objective function. \n",
    "To select good $\\alpha$, it’s also best to monitor the progress of your training. \n",
    "In many cases, a learning rate of 0.1 or 0.01 is a very good start, if you use SGD.\n",
    "For other optimizers like Adam, starting learning rate can differ. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Choosing Hyperparamters. \n",
    "Picking good hyperparameters (architectural parameters such as number of layers, number of neurons\n",
    "on each layers) for your neural networks can be difficult and is a topic of current research. \n",
    "A standard way to pick architectural parameters is via cross-validation: Keep a hold-out validation set that the training never touches. \n",
    "If the method performs well on the training data but not the validation set, then the model overfits: it has too many degrees of freedom and remembers the training cases but does not generalize to new cases. \n",
    "If the model overfits, we need to reduce the number of hidden layers or number of neurons on each hidden layer. \n",
    "If the method performs badly on the training set then the model underfits: it does not have enough degrees of freedom and we should increase the number of hidden layers or number of neurons. \n",
    "Be warned that bad performance on the training set can also mean that the learning rate is chosen poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hyperparameter Optimization. \n",
    "Picking good hyperparameters can also be automated using grid search, random search or Bayesian\n",
    "optimization. \n",
    "In grid search, every possible combination of hyperparameters will be tried and crossvalidated with a hold-out validation set. \n",
    "In case that grid search is expensive because the number of hyperparameters is large, one can try random search where hyperparameter configurations are generated and tried at random. \n",
    "Bayesian optimization looks at the performances of networks at previous hyperparameter combinations and fits a function through these points, it then picks the next combination that maximizes some utility function such as the mean plus some function of the uncertainty. "

    "- Precision of float variables. \n",
